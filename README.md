# Dripp

## Content Walkthrough


Dripp is an e-commerce web application made for an incredible artist by the name of Laura Nahas to sell her paintings online. This web app contains two data tables, one for paintings that are for sale and another to display purchase history. These tables are only visible to users with an admin account. All other users have the ability to read about the website on the home page and browse (and hopefully purchase) the paintings for sale on the products page. The front end was developed Angular 7 and the web API was developed with ASP.NET Core 2.0. This program integrates two third-party services by the name of Stripe and Cloudinary. Stripe allows us to safely handle transactions and Cloudinary allows us to outsource the storage of image files. Future versions of this project will include the ability for more clients to sell their artwork via a membership-based system and much more! Come to Dripp and check out the awesome artwork!
